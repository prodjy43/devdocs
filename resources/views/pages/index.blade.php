            <h2>Why y make this website.</h2>
            <p>Cause during all the year i coding i realize this is not always easy to find something. You can easyly lost time on google and i don't wont to wast my coding time in futilities like this. Then i make this website to have all documentation i want in the same place and for all langage i want.</p>
            <h2>How it work ?</h2>
            <p>That's a good question hihi ! My website work with account and role for each user. After you login you can see all langage documentation you want put favorite page or langage and use the forum. There is a color table if you want to do a new website and you don't know what color is good and work well on website.</p>
            <h2>Can we put our documentation ?</h2>
            <p>Yes for sure you can it's the reason why i make this website a community documentation on all langage you want. In the future or the webiste i will make a reward system for user who make documentation tutoriel or help on forum. But it's not for today ^^</p>
